     * thread's event loop.  When doing long-running operations,
     * network calls, or heavy disk I/O, you should kick off a new

     *                except {@link #START_STICKY_COMPATIBILITY}.
     * @param flags   Additional data about this start request.
     * @param startId A unique integer representing this specific request to
     *                start.  Use with {@link #stopSelfResult(int)}.
     * @return The return value indicates what semantics the system should
     * use for the service's current started state.  It may be one of the
     * constants associated with the {@link #START_CONTINUATION_MASK} bits.
